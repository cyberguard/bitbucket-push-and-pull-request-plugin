        Allow you to override the URL in the bitbucket payload from the webhook so that it match the
        url you define in the SCM configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are seeing the message
        <ul>
            <i>skipping resolution of commit eef18d94302f5a3945796e77ee8ec46a69fd1ddf, since it originates from another repository</i>
        </ul>
        then most likely the JSON posted by Bitbucket to your Jenkins Webhook has a URL of the type
        <ul>https://bitbucket.org/XXXX/YYYY</ul>
        but your SCM Repository URL config has another url
    </p>

    <p>
        This allows you to update the URL inside the JSON received from BitBucket to match that of your SCM config.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example:
        <pre>
        {
        "https://bitbucket.org/XXXX/YYYY" : "https://ZZZZ@bitbucket.org/XXXX/YYYY.git"
        }
        </pre>
        would change the URL from <i>https://bitbucket.org/XXXX/YYYY</i> to <i>https://ZZZZ@bitbucket.org/XXXX/YYYY.git</i>
        before
        trying to match it to your SCM config.
    </p>
